# Key Takeaways

- **Data** is information that is processed by computers, broken down into basic **primitives** like integers, floats, and strings, and organized into **data structures** for efficient access and manipulation.

- **Data Structures** are specialized formats used to store and organize data in ways that optimize performance, memory usage, and the execution of specific operations like searching, sorting, and inserting. Examples include arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

- **Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or rules used to solve problems, often working with data structures to process data efficiently. The goal of an algorithm is to find the most optimal solution, balancing correctness, efficiency, and resource usage.

- **Efficiency** is key: Both **data structures** and **algorithms** are designed with the goal of optimizing **time** and **space** complexity to handle increasingly large data sets and problems.
